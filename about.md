The Pinellas Green Foundation is dedicated to advancing sustainable energy solutions and environmental stewardship in Pinellas County, Florida.

## Our Mission

We believe that a sustainable future is built one community at a time. Our mission is to support and promote green energy initiatives that benefit local organizations, reduce environmental impact, and create a more resilient community.

## What We Do

We partner with churches, community centers, and local organizations to implement practical green energy solutions, including:

- Electric vehicle charging stations
- Solar energy installations
- Energy efficiency improvements
- Community education and outreach

## Our Founder

Bryan Beckman is the Founder and President of the Pinellas Green Foundation. Over the past decade, Bryan has been helping others - both personally and through his leadership role with the Suncoast Sierra Club - to save on their energy bills and reduce pollution. The Pinellas Green Foundation expands that work to have an even larger impact on the community.
